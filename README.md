# Introduction to ProGrocery
Before we start, you may want to check out [Open-Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/Open-source_software) and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/Linux) for technical details. For other stuff, checkout your [local grocery store](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02OUGZKvmi9pDiKuuFOv1rcnUNeDw%3A1614795980208&source=hp&ei=zNQ_YOvsCNis5NoPpoGNuAw&iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYD_i3LsxuL7em7qhzNiFvqlsRu8zX6_e&q=grocery+store+near+me&oq=grocery+store+near+me&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAgAELEDEMkDMgUIABCSAzIFCAAQkgMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoKCAAQsQMQgwEQQzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BQgAELEDOgQIABBDOgoILhDHARCvARBDOgcIABCxAxBDOgcIABCHAhAUUJMBWOMTYPYUaABwAHgAgAGhAYgBhhSSAQQ0LjE3mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjrgqDm35TvAhVYFlkFHaZAA8cQ4dUDCAg&uact=5)

## What is ProGrocery?
Long story short, it's a program that will help you with your groceries. It may seem kinda dumb, and it is, but the more features we add, the better it will become. As of right now, it's just a terminal-only application (designed for Linux/UNIX systems), but we hope to make it more than that.

## How can I run this?
Running it is easy! Compile it using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipskore/progrocery.git
cd progrocery
g++ main.cpp -o pg
./pg
```

### Compile requirements
As of right now, you only need g++ installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it on Debian systems by running "sudo apt-get install g++". If you're on another system or use a different package manager, use the equivalent command.


# Contributing
If you'd like to contribute code to the project, that would be great! We are actually pretty desperate for code! File out a pull request once you've added some snazzy features.
